## 😎 About me...
* I am passionate about technology because it empowers me to push the boundaries of my potential and bridges the gap between what is currently impossible and what will be possible tomorrow. I'm a driven and ever-evolving solutionist who focuses on solving modern problems with a determined but adaptable approach.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning...
* I'm currently enrolled at Nucamp in a bootcamp to learn more about backend, SQL, and DevOps with Python. We are studying fundamental and complex algorithms and data structures, and will learn how to deploy robust applications built with Python to the cloud with Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.
* I am also taking it upon myself to learn more about networking, cybersecurity practices, and penetration testing tools.

## 🔭 I'm currently working on...
* I'm always working on and trying to improve my personal portfolio site. I gladly welcome any and all feedback:
https://www.justinmiles.io
* I am building a terminal-based Choose Your Own Adventure RPG game called The Colorado Trail, inspired by the classic Oregon Trail game.
* I am building a mobile recipe/ingredient application with React Native for people with special diets or allergies.

## ✨ Fun facts:

* I have lived in 5 states already!
* I have three pets - two dogs and one cat.
* I'm missing one organ - can you guess which one?
